# CodeIgniter + Bootstrap + Basic Template

I have combined *CodeIgniter* **3.1.11** with *Bootstrap* **4.3.1**, *jQuery* **3.4.1** and a basic template into one project to make starting a new project even faster and easier than standalone CodeIgniter. Feel free to use as you want, I will try to keep it up to date with the most recent releases of CodeIgniter, jQuery and Bootstrap.

To view the basic template go to **/index.php/Boot**. I left the original Welcome controller as default to keep everything CodeIgniter as if you just downloaded, I will only add files to, not change anything from the default CodeIgniter.
