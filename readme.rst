CodeIgniter + Bootstrap + Basic Template
###################
I have put CodeIgniter 3.0.3 with Bootstrap 3.3.5 and a basic template into one project, it makes for much quicker start ups of projects. Feel free to use as you want, I will try to keep it up to date.

To view the basic template go to **index.php/Boot**. I left the original Welcome controller as default to keep everything CodeIgniter as if you just downloaded, I will only add files to, not change any from default CodeIgniter.
