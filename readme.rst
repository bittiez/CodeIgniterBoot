CodeIgniter + Bootstrap + Basic Template
###################
I have combined CodeIgniter **3.1.2** with Bootstrap **3.3.7**, jQuery **3.1.1** and a basic template into one project to make starting a new project even faster and easier then standalone CodeIgniter. Feel free to use as you want, I will try to keep it up to date with the most recent releases of CodeIgniter and Bootstrap.

To view the basic template go to **index.php/Boot**. I left the original Welcome controller as default to keep everything CodeIgniter as if you just downloaded, I will only add files to, not change anything from the default CodeIgniter.
